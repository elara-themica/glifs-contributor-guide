This is the GLIFS developer and contributor guide.

Please be aware that development is still in the proof of concept phase. Specifically, this means:

- While I have a good feeling for the overall goals of the project, many of the concepts still need to be fleshed out,
  and others have not been documented.
- While any potential collaborators would be given a __WARM__ welcome, for now the best form of that would be to reach
  out via email to get in touch and have a conversation.
